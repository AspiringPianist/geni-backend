Generate a Visual Summary in JSON format for the topic "{title}" The summary should be divided into 3-5 sections, each representing a key event or era. For each section, include:
- A "title" (short, descriptive heading),
- A "text" field (2-3 sentences summarizing the event/era),
- Placeholder fields for "imageUrl" and "audioUrl" (set as empty strings for now).

Ensure the content is engaging, concise, and suitable for an immersive, story-like presentation with visuals and audio narration. The JSON should follow this schema:
{
  "title": "Visual Summary Title",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Section Title",
      "text": "Section summary text",
      "imageUrl": "",
      "audioUrl": ""
    }
  ]
}
